# Tox24 Challenge
## About
The Tox24 Challenge aims to advance computational methods for predicting in vitro activity of compounds using chemical structure data. This follows the Tox21 Challenge, leveraging new data, novel modeling strategies, and diverse applications. Additional details on the competition can be found <a href="https://ochem.eu/static/challenge.do">here</a>.

## Data
The dataset includes compounds tested against Transthyretin (TTR) within the Tox21 initiative by the EPA:

1. Training set: 1012 compounds \
2. Leaderboard set: 200 compounds \
3. Blind set: 300 compounds \
4. Structural data (SMILES) sourced from EPAâ€™s CompTox Chemicals Dashboard and PubChem
